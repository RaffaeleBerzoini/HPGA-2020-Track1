# HPGA-2020-Track_1 by Colombo Aurora A.F. and Berzoini Raffaele

To execute our implementation the three .java files has to belong to the same package. Don't forget to chage the string p value with the directory to your .txt file.
In the Main threads we left you some comments to store a subset and also in while loop a System.out.println() to print the results 
[!DO NOT: print results for queries whith a large amount of results, i.e. depth>1. If you want to see results for depth>1, please uncomment the try-catch expression located at lines 224-231 of IntTable.java and lines 204-211 of CSR.java and comment line 223 in IntTable and 203 in CSR].

You need to run the "public static void main" located in Main.java class. 

You can find the data recollected during tests for the heuristic engine in the _SwitchingPoint.xlsx_ file
